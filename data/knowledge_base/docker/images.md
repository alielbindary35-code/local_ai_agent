1. **Docker Images Overview\n\nDocker images are read-only templates that contain the instructions to build a Docker container. They are built from layers and can be shared and reused.\n\n2. **Image Layers\n\nEach layer represents a set of changes to the filesystem. Images are composed of multiple layers, which are cached for faster builds.\n\n3. **Building Images\n\nUse a Dockerfile to define the steps for building an image. Commands like `FROM`, `RUN`, and `COPY` are used.\n\n4. **Image Commands\n\n- `docker build`: Build an image from a Dockerfile.\n- `docker pull`: Download an image from Docker Hub.\n- `docker images`: List locally available images.\n- `docker rmi`: Remove unused images.\n\n5. **Image Tags and Repositories\n\nImages can be tagged with names and pushed to repositories like Docker Hub for sharing.\n\n🔗 Source: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/
